# mobile_detection_opamps

Introducing an innovative mobile device detection system leveraging operational amplifiers (op-amps). In response to the escalating need for efficient and cost-effective detection methods amidst the pervasive use of mobile devices, this project offers a solution that harnesses op-amps' capabilities. The system, designed for simplicity, low cost, and energy efficiency, employs op-amp circuits to analyze electromagnetic signals emitted by mobile devices. Key signal characteristics, including amplitude and frequency modulation patterns, enable accurate differentiation. With proven effectiveness in experimental results, this scalable op-amp architecture holds promise for integration into diverse infrastructures, such as security systems and smart environments.
